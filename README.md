# Wealth Analysis Simulation Project

A comprehensive Python-based simulation and analysis framework for understanding wealth dynamics, creation, distribution, and the impact of AI on economic systems.

## Project Overview

This project explores multiple dimensions of wealth through data-driven simulations and visualizations:

- **Wealth Creation**: Various pathways to wealth generation
- **Value Chain Analysis**: Economic production and distribution cycles
- **Wealth Distribution**: Inequality metrics and distribution patterns
- **Wealth Management**: Portfolio optimization and risk strategies
- **Wealth Accumulation**: Compound growth and investment scenarios
- **AI Impact**: How artificial intelligence affects wealth patterns

## Features

- ðŸ”¬ **Advanced Simulations**: Monte Carlo methods, agent-based modeling
- ðŸ“Š **Rich Visualizations**: Interactive charts, heatmaps, and dashboards
- ðŸ“ˆ **Economic Models**: Gini coefficient, Pareto distribution, wealth inequality metrics
- ðŸ¤– **AI Integration**: Analysis of AI's impact on wealth creation and distribution
- ðŸŽ¯ **Scenario Planning**: Multiple economic scenarios and stress testing

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from src.wealth_creation import WealthCreationSimulator
from src.visualization import WealthDashboard

# Create wealth simulation
simulator = WealthCreationSimulator()
results = simulator.run_simulation()

# Generate visualizations
dashboard = WealthDashboard()
dashboard.create_wealth_distribution_chart(results)
```
